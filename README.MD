## ![Wand ü™Ñ](https://github.com/El-Machine/Wand/raw/main/App/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/magic-wand-transformed-20.png) API for Any (thing) |
**üì¶ An ideal API acts as the [black box](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackbox)**  
**‚ö°Ô∏è It‚Äôs possible to incapsulate whole data receiving and memory managment duty to one symbol**  
**?**

>In Unix-like computer operating systems, a [pipeline](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(Unix)) is a mechanism for inter-process communication using message passing. A pipeline is a set of processes chained together by their standard streams, so that the output text of each process (stdout) is passed directly as input (stdin) to the next one. The second process is started as the first process is still executing, and they are executed concurrently.

### üí¨ bash
```bash
command1 | command2 | command3

ls -l | grep key | less
```

### üïäÔ∏è swift
```bash
#Create handler  
{ (bar: Bar) in

}

```

```bash
#Black box
prefix func | (handler: @escaping (Bar)->() )

#Call API
| { (bar: Bar) in

}

```

```bash
#Retreive data (profit)
handler(bar)

``` 

### ‚öôÔ∏è usage

```bash

#Request current Location
|{ (location: CLLocation) in 

}

#Request .authorizedAlways permissions once
CLAuthorizationStatus.authorizedAlways | .one { status in
            
}

#Update Pedometer Data
|{ (data: CMPedometerData) in 

}

#Scan for Bluetooth Peripheral
|{ (peripheral: CBPeripheral) in 

}

#Wait for a Notification
UIWindow.keyboardWillShowNotification | { (n: Notification) in
            
}

#Enumerate Contacts
CNContact.predicateForContacts(matchingName: "John") | .every { (contact: CNContact) in
                        
}

#Scan a tag
|.every { (tag: NFCNDEFTag) in

}

#Perform Face Observation
URL(string: "http://example.com/image.jpg") | { (faces: [VNFaceObservation]) in

}

#Perform Pose Observation
data | .while { (bodies: [VNHumanBodyPoseObservation]) in
    bodies < 2
}

#Detect shake
|{ (motion: UIEvent.EventSubtype) in
    if motion == .motionShake {
                
    }
}

```

```bash
#Customization
let wand = |{ (hands: [VNHumanHandPoseObservation]) in

}

let request: VNDetectHumanHandPoseRequest = wand.obtain()
request.maximumHandCount = 4

let preview: AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer = wand.obtain()
view.layer.addSublayer(preview!)
```

### üí° Idea
  Imagine that you have the black box that can give you an ```Any``` object.   
  You don't know what's already in the box or what will happen inside   
      
  Ask for object that you need |

### ü™Ñ –°oncept

Wand started from the idea about receiving anything in most efficient way. 
  
Add one sign to completion handler and retreive the result üì¶
